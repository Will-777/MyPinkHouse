### Disclaimer :
Never really read anything seriously about building into minecraft & programming.
My Daughter wanted to build a house into Minecraft Pi and I wanted to see what it 
would cost to me making that by coding.
As usual, I coded that with my foot but as long as it works !
While typing, I realized that sometimes, there is a "patern" that could be 
reused. I tried that as well. (oh gosh...)

### Cool feature :
realized that there is about 3~5 main color on that house.
It will not cost that much to make fixed color var (Purple, Pink, Magenta, White) 
into var that we could customise and BarbyHouse could be changed to 
Alcatraz. I'll try to add that...

### Not yet Done:
- the decoration insised is not yet done.
- I would like to put a stairs inside...
- 2th Floors ?


### How does it work:
- check the wiki
